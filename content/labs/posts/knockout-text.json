  "body": "## Is some content destined for boredom on the Internet?\nUnlike this article's really boring title (*knockout text*), blog/news posts use eye catching titles to hook readers. Coming up with that perfect title definitely takes skill, you have to know your audience and apply some SEO insights. Regardless of expertise however, content is going to make or break it.\n\nPoor title's aren't necessarily a byproduct of poor content. Non text medium's can have great value, but still suffer when it comes to a title. The more abstract a topic, the harder it will be to summarize and capture in a few short words. Like this one from Buzzfeed:\n\n[![Example Buzzfeed title](https://i.gyazo.com/4a95193526cbdbeeb08798c0b2957c3b.png)](https://gyazo.com/4a95193526cbdbeeb08798c0b2957c3b)\n\nThis raised the question of how traditionally poorly titled content, can take another approach to hook its readers.\n\n## How can media be included in the title\n\nI came up with art and artists portfolios as the hardest thing I could think to title. Specifically minimalism, where it's commonplace for artists to not even title the Physical works. Take a look at minimalist [Donald Judd's portfolio](https://juddfoundation.org/artist/art/) a serial offender of naming things \"*Untitled #XX*\", which unfortunately caught up with him when the internet was created and he had to blog. The result is a list of work that doesn't give much value to click through, the entire content (piece of art) can be viewed before entering any pages.\n\n[![Donald Judd's portfolio](https://i.gyazo.com/b73e54eb84d088c99761edaf5856b859.gif)](https://gyazo.com/b73e54eb84d088c99761edaf5856b859)\n\nBringing in a taste of whats to come from Judd's artwork had to be possible. Other mediums had accomplished richer title's, movie's have their posters, and music their album covers. To use the work from traditional artist, the piece had to be given as a sample that would encourage the user to view more.\n\nThis project aims at teasing a physical work in the hero moment to encourage further readership. My hope is that the encumbered photo peaks interest in the piece, but not enough to have taken in all the value. Similar to a digestible title, media can be previewed as well.\n\n"
