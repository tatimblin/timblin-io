  "body": "Unlike this article's really boring title (*knockout text*), most posts on the internet go for something a lot more eye catching to hook their readers. Coming up with a good title definitely takes skill, you have to know your audience and apply some SEO insight. Regardless of expertise, content above all is going to play a major role in how effective its title will be.\n\nThis raised the question of how traditionally poorly titled content, can take another approach to hook its readers. I came up with artistic portfolio's as being of great quality content, with little to work with in terms of post titles. Usually all that makes it to the title is the name of the work. Depending on the artist this can look [very repetitive](https://juddfoundation.org/artist/art/) and uninspiring for engagement.\n\n## A good title teases the content\nThere's a reason listicles do so well on the internet. The content of a Buzzfeed post can be easily condensed in the title, hooking readers with a good expectation of what they'll find. Their recent post [23 Fyre Festival Documentary Tweets That Are Tragic And True](https://www.buzzfeed.com/javiermoreno/fyre-festival-tweets-2?ref=hpsplash) is exactly what you'd think it is. \n\n\n## Including rich content in the hook"
